# Intercom 3rd Party Libaray

This is an unofficial api for Intercom (https://developers.intercom.io/).

## Why do we need this ?

Intercom has a great SDK for PHP officially supported (https://github.com/intercom/intercom-php). If you are running PHP 5.6+
it should be your first choice. I wrote this Libaray to make sure its compatible with
PHP 5.3+ , for systems running older versions of PHP without the ability to upgrade
the servers this might be useful.
